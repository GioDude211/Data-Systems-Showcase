Core Idea is to use the Banker's algorithm as resource allocation management in an operating system.
 * 				 The goal is to ensure the system remains in a safe state, meaning there's a sequence in which all processes
 * 				 can complete their work without causing a deadlock.
 * 				 GOAL: Tha "banker" only grants a resource request if doing so leaves the system in a safe state. Requests leading
 * 				 to an unsafe state is denied.
